# Autonomous Event Planning Team: Multi-Agent Event Orchestration System

## 📌 Problem Statement

Planning events such as workshops, conferences, college fests, or meetups requires coordination across logistics, budgeting, scheduling, promotions, and risk management. Decisions made by one team often impact others, making collaboration essential.

Traditional tools assist with isolated tasks, but successful event execution depends on structured coordination between multiple roles working toward a shared objective.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🌍 Context

The Autonomous Event Planning Team simulates an organizing committee where specialized AI agents collaborate under an **Event Manager (Manager Agent)** to design, refine, and finalize a complete event execution plan.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🚧 Key Real-World Challenges

- Event planning involves multiple interdependent tasks.
- Budget, logistics, and promotion decisions influence each other.
- Planning requires iterative refinement and coordination.
- Miscommunication leads to scheduling conflicts or resource issues.
- Final execution demands unified decision synthesis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Project Goal

Build an **Autonomous Multi-Agent System** that:

- Breaks event planning into specialized agent roles.
- Coordinates collaboration through hierarchical delegation.
- Uses structured reasoning workflows.
- Applies reflection to refine planning decisions.
- Produces a complete event execution strategy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠 Problem Description

This project focuses on engineering a **Stateful Multi-Agent Event Planning System** that:

- Defines role-based planning responsibilities.
- Models workflows using state machines (LangGraph).
- Enables collaboration between planning agents.
- Applies reflection to improve plans iteratively.
- Synthesizes outputs into a unified event blueprint.
- Optimizes workflow efficiency and coordination.

Example prompts:

- *"Plan a one-day AI workshop for 200 participants."*
- *"Adjust the event plan within a reduced budget."*
- *"Review risks and improve execution readiness."*

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Define event planning roles and responsibilities  
2. Design workflow using LangGraph  
3. Implement base agents  
4. Add manager delegation logic  
5. Integrate reflection loop  
6. Optimize workflow  
7. Test with multiple event scenarios  
8. Document architecture and reasoning flow  

> **Note:** Focus on coordinated planning and decision orchestration rather than generating a static event checklist.
